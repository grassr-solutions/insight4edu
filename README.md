# INS⬆GHT (Intelligent Survey Interpretation for Grading, Heuristics, and Teaching)

## Overview
INS⬆GHT is an advanced tool designed to provide more objective analysis of student evaluations for teaching assessment. It addresses the limitations of traditional evaluation methods through data-driven approaches and natural language processing.

## Traditional Student Evaluations - Limitations
- Ambiguous numerical ratings:
  - Ambiguous interpretation
  - Non-linear difference between rating points
  - Misleading averages that don't accurately represent polarized opinions
- Strong correlation with expected grades and course enjoyment rather than teaching effectiveness
- Potential misrepresentation in narrative summaries

## INS⬆GHT Advantages
- Survey turnaround of under 2 working days
- Eliminates misleading "final averages"
- Compares evaluations across the grade spectrum
- Uses research-backed questions measuring input rather than output
- Employs NLP for objective analysis of student narratives
- Serves as a baseline for peer or self-review
- Complements classroom observation for milestone reviews
- Integrates with teaching portfolio assessment

## Technical Limitations
- Comment summaries limited to approximately 2,000,000 characters (~4,000 pages)
- Currently supports English language only
